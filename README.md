# starry

This repository contains Python code designed to complement the [Starry Data App](https://starrydata.vercel.app), a tool for interactively generating and visualizing datasets through a drawing interface. The script extends the functionality of the app by providing a way to visualize decision boundaries of classifiers using the generated datasets.
