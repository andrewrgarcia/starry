# starry

This repository contains Python code designed to complement the [Starry Data App](https://starrydata.vercel.app), a tool inspired by the [drawdata](https://github.com/koaning/drawdata) Python library, for interactively generating and visualizing datasets through a drawing interface. The [script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewrgarcia/starry/refs/heads/main/starry/script.py) extends the functionality of the app by providing a way to visualize decision boundaries of classifiers using the generated datasets.
